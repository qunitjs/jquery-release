Usage: node release.js [--pre-release=version] [--branch=branch] [--remote=repo]

OPTIONS
	--pre-release=version
		Creates a pre-release instead of a stable release. Since the
		version number can't be determined automatically, it must be
		provided, and must be a valid semver.

	--branch=branch
		Specifies which branch to create the release from.

		Default: master.

	--remote=repo
		Specifies the remote repository to work with. There are three
		ways to specify the remote:

		- GitHub Repository (user/repo)
		- File System (/path/to/repo)
		- URL (http://mydomain/repo.git)

		Regardless of which method is used to specify the remote, the
		part after the last slash must match the repo name on GitHub.

TEST RELEASES
	To test the release process without affecting any official
	repositories, specify a file system path, such as your clone
	of qunitjs/qunit. Or your personal fork myname/qunit on GitHub.

	When --remote is set to something that doesn't start with "qunitjs/",
	the release script will automatically be in "Test mode", which
	means among other things that the "CDN" tasks push to jquery/fake-cdn.git
	instead of the real one, and that the "npm" tasks are skipped.
